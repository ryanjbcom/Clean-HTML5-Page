# Clean-HTML5-Page
A Clean HTML 5 Page

Built this repo to have the proper, clean html 5 page.

That's it.

You will find a lot of people using websites builers or copy & pasting code.

After a while you can detect a mix of old code format blended with the new.

This creates problems, unclean code, unclean formatting and can lead to website errors.

Check out Index.html within this repo....

I think I'll drop index files for older tech..... we shall see.
